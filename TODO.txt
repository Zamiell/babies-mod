TODO:

- refactor global variables
- SaveDataManager
- auto generate documentation from parsing babies.ts
- use tainted blue baby poop from gamonymous suggestion
- 10x intruder baby

Babies to change:
- Gold Baby : Add golden battery
- Butthole Baby : Add T. ??? special poops to the List
- get rid of O Baby - Starts with Tiny Planet
- Cloud Baby : Ventricle Razor every 15 seconds is kinda pointless. Every 2 seconds helps with curse rooms but can be annoying in combat
- Fishman Baby : The enum says that it's impossible to spawn Giga Bombs with BombSubType.NULL, would be cool if the baby could spawn giga bombs
- Puncher Baby : It appear that the difference isn't very noticeable between 1 and 10 Punching Bags. 1 Punching Bag + 1 Lost Fly would make enemies more unpredictable
- Brown Baby : Add Dingle Berry
- Dark Elf Baby : Change to "Starts with Polished bone"
- Cubic Baby : Add Scatter Bombs
- Lantern Baby : Since GodHead now deals fixed damage, it might be not very powerful, maybe add extra damage?
- Tired Baby (#443) - 1 Bum Friend is actually better than 5 since each bum friend require several coins to payout. 1 Bum Friend require 6 coins to drop the first pickup. Rewards are the same than Lil Chest rewards + items from Beggar item pool which is mostly HP ups and they can eat lucky coins without granting the luck up, let's just change this one
- Twotone Baby (#346) - Dataminer effect on room enter - stat changes would persist to the next floor

Potential new effects:
- spawn Lil Portal portal after picking up 8 pickups
- Touching items/pickups causes experimental pill effect
- Glitched pickups (all pickups rotate between 5 pickups like Glitched Crown on items)
- Shaking screen every 5 seconds
- Exploding a tinted rock teleports you to a random special room (item room, shop, planetarium, devil deal, angel room, error room, black market, secret room, super secret room, ultra secret room, mini-boss room, boss room, arcade, challenge, curse, sacrifice, library, Vault, Dice room, bedrooms) (Prevent this effect from appearing in Chest and Dark Room)
- Enemies turn into giant poops when touched (improved E. Coli)
- Every sound effect is randomized
- Starts with 3 Knife piece 1 + 3 Knife Piece 2
- Spawn every type of machine in the starting room
- Spawns a golden troll bomb in every room
- Starts with Cursed Penny
- Starts with 10 Cube Baby + Ice Cube
- Starts with 5 Fruity plum + Baby-Bender + Forgotten Lullaby + Blindfolded
- Glowing Hourglass effect on 2nd hit (per room)
